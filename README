Real World Haskell
==================

Programming is fun and I would like to learn new things all the time so I can have a bigger and better toolbox for solving problems. As many people recommended this book as a great guide to get in the thick of it, and also to be a better functional programmer in Python (my current favorite past-time and workhorse).

These code snippets are not guarantied to work or to be optimal or to be kind to you. Probably you don't even want to look at them, and that's fine. If you find this useful in any way, then you are more than welcome. 

Check out the book at the [Real World Haskell website][1]. If you want to learn more, I highly recommend the "other" big functional programming book, [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][2].
